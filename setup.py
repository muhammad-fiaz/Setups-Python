Installation Complete!

Once you've installed the package, you can now use the 'setup' command to generate setup.py for your Python project.

Usage:
    setup <project_name>

This will ask you a series of questions to generate a setup.py file for your project. Once the setup.py is generated:

ðŸŽ‰ Here's what you need to do next to upload your package to PyPI:

Step 1: Create the Distribution
--------------------------------
Run the following commands to build the distribution:

    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

This creates both source (.tar.gz) and wheel (.whl) distributions in the dist/ folder.

Step 2: Upload to PyPI
-----------------------
Once you've built the distribution, upload it to PyPI with the following:

    twine upload dist/*

This will prompt you for your PyPI credentials and upload your package.

You're all set to share your package with the world! ðŸš€
